Repository containing all files for nEXO

Brief overview: I run OD simulations in two steps: first the photons are simulated, then the analysis is run. Out of memory considerations, the first step is to separate the million muon CSV file (millionMuon.csv) into many smaller files.

1) Separate millionMuon.csv

2) Generation of "Simulation" batch job/YAML cards.

Relevant files: 


3) Generation of "Analysis" batch job / YAML cards.
4) more?
